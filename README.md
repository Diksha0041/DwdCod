### Instructions for including images:

1. Store your images in the `images` folder of your GitHub repository.
2. Update the image paths in the markdown (e.g., `./images/training-web-app.jpg`) based on where you place your images.

### Notes on Adding Images:
- The images (`training-web-app.jpg`, `servicenow-app.jpg`, `skills.jpg`, etc.) should be added to your repository (in a folder called `images` or similar).
- For dynamic GitHub stats, you can use the service [GitHub Readme Stats](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats).
- Feel free to replace the placeholders (e.g., `your-username`, `your-email@example.com`, `your-portfolio.com`) with your actual information.
